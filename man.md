Grok your data

The objective of bioSyntax is to bring you closer to your data, giving you an [intuitive & empathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) understanding of biology. To appreciate all that bioSyntax has to offer read this short manual (~10 minutes) and go explore.

# Getting Started

### [See: Installing bioSyntax](../install)

bioSyntax integreates seamlessly with **vim** *(Linux / Mac / Win)*, **sublime** *(Linux / Mac / Win)*, **gedit** *(Linux / Win)*, & **less** *(Linux / Mac)*. After installing bioSyntax files will automatically detected by file-extension.


### Reading large-data

For very large data sets, it's often slow to open them in a text editor. It's best to use the command-line program **less** which will read your file from a data-stream.

##### Read your large-data set with **less** directly

```
# If your file is uncompressed, it can be read directly.
# less will recognize the file extension (.XYZ)

cd ~/myData/

less dbSNP107_common.vcf

less hg19.fa
```
{: .language-bash}
##### Streaming your data directly into **less** with pipes `|`

```
# If your file is compressed, you can 'pipe' the data 
# using the "|" operator from decompression, directly into
# less. You must prefix the file extension you want
# as file formats are not recognized within streams.

cd ~/myCompressedData/ 

samtools view -h NA12878_hg38.bam | sam-less

gzip -dc dbSNP107_rare.vcf.gz | vcf-less

gzip -dc hg38.fa.gz | fa-less
```
{: .language-bash}

##### Bypassing bioSyntax (data in plain-text)

For **vim**
Type `:syntax off` in vim

For **less**

```
# You may want to view your data without syntax highlighting
# such as where a file is improperly formatted or very large
# files where syntax highlighting may be slow (i.e. VCF files
# with hundreds of columns).

# 1. Pipe your data through cat
cat snp_1000genomes.vcf | less - 

# 2. Within less, switch to a visual editor
less snp_1000genomes.vcf
  # press 'CTRL-C' to stop process
  # press 'v' to switch to visual editor
```
{: .language-bash}

# Reading Data

### Nucleotides

bioSyntax implements a novel, full [IUPAC Nucleotide Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_notation#IUPAC_notation) coloring. Ambiguous bases are represented by an ~additive color-mixing of the parent bases. For example, **T**hymine (blue) + **C**ytosine (red) are both p**Y**rimidines (magenta).

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="../images/man/nt_IUPAC_ANSI_v0.3_web.png"></div>

An intuitive feature of the bioSyntax color scheme is that the 'GC-content' of a sequence can be quickly approximated by how warm (high GC, red-orange) or cool (low GC, blue-green) a sequence looks.

```
vim myc_gcContent.fa
```
{: .language-bash}
<div><img src="../images/screens/fa-vim_myc_gc.png"></div>

### PHRED Scores

When available, bioSyntax will highlight [PHRED quality scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score) in a step-gradient of blacks (PHRED = 0-10) to whites (PHRED = 40+).

<div><img src="../images/man/sublime-PHRED.png"></div>

### CIGAR Strings

In `.sam` files the Query:Reference alignment is summarized efficiently but illegibly as a [CIGAR String](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/SAM#What_is_a_CIGAR.3F). With a little bit of highlighting these become much easier to read.

<div><img src="../images/man/less-CIGAR.png"></div>


### Amino Acid Color Schemes

You can choose from several color-schemes for amino-acid fasta files. The `Fasta Clustal` (Default) syntax colors amino acids based on their [physiochemical properties](http://www.jalview.org/help/html/colourSchemes/clustal.html), so does `Fasta Hydrophobicity`, or you may prefer better discrimination of each amino acids with `Fasta Zappo` or `Fasta Taylor`.

These syntaxes are not part of the unified bioSyntax suite but often serve specialized functions.

# Support 

## Report a bug / Ask a question

The fastest way to get an answer is to:

1) Search / Open an issue on the bioSyntax Repo. 

Please Include:
- A detailed and descriptive title.
- Enough information about what did for someone else to replicate the problem.
- Information about the operating system / software you're using (`uname -a`)
- If it's a syntax highlighting issue: a screenshot of the error and a small bit of the input file you used.

<a href="https://github.com/bioSyntax/bioSyntax/issues">
	<span class="btn btn-danger">Open an Issue</span></a>

2) If you really don't want to make a (fake) github account. Email [info@bioSyntax.org](mailto:info@bioSyntax.org) and we'll open the issue, but it will be slower.
