# We're Hiring!

The *RNAlab* is a highly collaborative, fast-paced research team. We're looking for passionate, self-motivated scientists with the ambition to tackle the most important problems in modern biology. Individuals from all backgrounds and experience-levels are encouraged to apply.

## Summer & Thesis Students

Whether you're a squishy biologist interested in learning to probe nature through very large computing; or a CS student interested in probing very large computers into some squishy nature (or anything in-between), we would love to join you on your journey.

Shoot me an [email](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca) with the subject `RNAlab App - Student`, please provide your CV, half a page on what your aspirations are and why you think RNAlab will help you get there. If you're particularily ambitious, write a one page research proposal of what you want to do for your research/thesis and we can use that as a starting point.   

## Graduate Students

The RNAlab is based out of [Molecular Genetics](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. To pursue your graduate research here will require you be accepted into MoGen (unless you make a case for another department). Once admitted, you have 3 lab-rotations to learn from different members of the department. I encourage rotation students to try out the lab! For admission requirements see:

- [MoGen Admission](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/academic-requirements)
- [MoGen International MSc Admission](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/international-students)

If you intend to apply or would like to discuss potential graduate work, shoot me an [email](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca) with the subject `RNAlab App - {MSc/PhD}`, please provide your CV, a page on what your aspirations are and why you think RNAlab will help you get there and write a one page research proposal of what you want to do for your research/thesis and we can use that as a starting point.   

## Post-docs / Engineers / Developers

We're looking to immediatly hire a talented [Computational Virologist](doc/app/RNAlab0001.pdf) or [Full-Stack Bioinformatician(/Developer)](doc/app/RNAlab0002.pdf). See job advertisements for how to apply.

Do you have an exceptional idea/talent which you think will be indispensible to the lab? Contact [artem [at] rRNA.ca](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca)

## RNAlab Fellow

Do you have an independent project/idea which you believe in? [Independent-lead](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04332-2) projects are in our RNA, and we're here to pay it forward. Take full ownership of your project and realize it as an RNAlab Fellow. The onus will be on you to bootstrap much of the [resources/logistics](https://pda.mit.edu/resources/funding-resources/), we can provide institutional support, and the locale for you to kick-start your own research program. Take full advantage of a world-class computational biology team to get your start. 

If you're interested, shoot me an [email](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca) with the subject `RNAlab App - Fellow`, with your plan and we can set up a discussion.

## Merit Application

We recieve *a lot* of applications, and it's difficult to distinguish generic applications from specific intentional ones. Also, with applications all over the world it's difficult to interpret the relative merit of each. To create an avenue for high-merit candidates with non-standard qualifications, or if your qualifications don't capture your talent, we have **Merit Problems**. These are non-trivial research problems which will require background research, thought, and some personal experimentation. Study them carefully and submit your ~1-2 page solution along with your application. Suffix the email subject with `- RNAmerit`. I can at least promise I will provide a detailed response to such applications.

- Merit Problem 1 - [Viral RdRp structure-function analysis](doc/merit/RNAmerit_001.pdf)
- Merit Problem 2 - [Computational acceleration of INFERNAL](doc/merit/RNAmerit_002.pdf)
- Merit Problem 3 - [Characterization of a deep RNA Virus](doc/merit/RNAmerit_003.pdf)
- Tackle a Evo/Genome problem (#21-30) of the [Unsolved problems of Evo-Devo](https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/lewheldquirk/puzzleq.htm#evolveii)
